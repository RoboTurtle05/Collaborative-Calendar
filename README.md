# Collaborative-Calendar

Project for The Banana Hacks 2021 ~ Best Experienced on Computer

Calendar X is a collaborative, toDo List, calendar or notepad. It tracks input and outputs it into a dashboardand is viewable.

Includes:

Includes script that takes input and inserts it onto the dashboard, or modifies prexisitng input and the page itself.
Includes UI based on Mouse clicks and Mouse controlling

Javascript
We used javascript events and object-oriented programming to track the 4 main properties of each input(name, id, )

CSS:
Mainly the use of a template, some additional CSS was implemented to better suite our formatting needs

HTML: 
Although using some from the source code because it directly binds with attributes in the long CSS font file, all HTML was used to create a webpage mocking an app

üëç What we did right:

Fun to work with people
Good effort for us beginners
Fufills every goals except one
Easy to use, simplistic but effective UI.
Functional

üëé What went wrong:
Despite attempts, couldn't get local storage to work to save list items when refreshing

‚ùì How to use:
Run on preferably laptop, this mock app's simple UI was designed for the cause but also users to navigate. Run the "frontpage" html file and the rest shoudl be explanatroy.
